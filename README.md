# Description:
To better understand which countries are global drivers of carbon emissions and their impact, you'll be leveraging CO2 emission data from 1750-2022

# Objectives:

**1.Profile and QA the data:**

First objective is to explore and profile the data while optimizing the source for visualization including: filtering out records which aren't at the country level, updating field types and creating a parameter.

**2.Prepare the data for visualization:**

Second objective is to visualize the data using a line chart, map and scatter plot to show the trends and relationships between CO2 emissions and country populations.

**3.Visualize the data and summarize findings:**

Final objective is to build an interactive dashboard combining your 3 visualizations in addition to filters/parameters for user interaction.

# Goal:
To transform data into a dynamic dashboard that can use to identify the patterns ,trends and drivers of global CO2 emissions.
